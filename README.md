# odin-recipes
My first Project from TheOdinProject (using basic HTML)

In this project, I'm going to build a basic recipe website.
The website will consist of a main index page which will have links to a few recipes.

#### Self-reflection

*Very basic HTML project, I did not learn anything new about HTML, as I had some previous experience.
But I used the Shell, Visual Studio Code and Git for the first time, that was awesome.
Looking forward to work more with those tools!*
