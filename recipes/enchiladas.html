        <li>Drain and rinse the canned beans. Then place in a large bowl and mash roughly with a potato masher (or fork) but do not purée.</li>
        <li>Add the mashed beans along with the corn, cooked rice, and chopped tomatoes to the vegetables in the pan. Season with red paprika powder, salt, pepper and a pinch of chili to taste.</li>

        <li>Place 3-4 tablespoons of the veggie filling on top of each tortilla and roll them up tightly. Arrange the stuffed enchiladas with the seam-side down next to each other in the prepared casserole dish. Then, spread the remaining tomato sauce over the enchiladas and sprinkle with diary-free cheese shreds as desired.</li>
